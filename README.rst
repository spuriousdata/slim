SLIM
****

=====
What
=====

Slim is a clean, simple, fast user database and manager. It can be queried with
the LDAP protocol or REST. Slim is NOT an LDAP server, it speaks just enough
LDAPv3 to allow clients that can authenticate against LDAP to authenticate using
Slim without needing new drivers or integrations.

=====
Why?
=====

I hate LDAP. I really really hate it. I hate using it, I hate running it, and I hate admining it. But still, it's everywhere. If you buy backup software, it auth's against LDAP. If you want central login across 100 Linux servers, you use LDAP.
