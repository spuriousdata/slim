=====
What
=====

Slim is a clean, simple, fast user database and manager. It can be queried with
the LDAP protocol or REST. Slim is NOT an LDAP server, it speaks just enough
LDAPv3 to allow clients that can authenticate against LDAP to authenticate using
Slim without needing new drivers or integrations.
